# 📜 GST Knowledge Base — AI-Readable GST Rules for Indian SMBs

## 1. GST Structure

India follows a dual GST model:

* **CGST** – Central Goods & Services Tax
* **SGST** – State GST (intra-state transactions)

Rule:
If supplier and buyer are in same state → CGST + SGST
If different states → IGST applies.

## 2. GST Registration Threshold (SMBs)

Businesses must register if turnover exceeds:
